# About the website

## Viewing the website

This website isn't currently hosted *to my knowledge*(meaning you can't find it on the internet). However, if you would like to view the website you can download the code and run it locally. Steps on how to do this can be found below.

1. Click the "Code" button at the top of this page.
2. Click the "Download ZIP" button

3. This should download a file onto your computer. Double click it which should create a folder named `SubjectSelectionWebsite-main`
4. Open the folder and find a file that ends in `.html` and double click it, this will open the website.

If I were you, I would also use a computer(latop/desktop) to do this, and not a phone or tablet.

## Information about the website
**Information may be outdated.** This website was coded in the first half of 2022, so if anything has changed since then, this website won't update to reflect those changes.

The website isn't responsive(meaning that it looks good on most screen sizes), but it works fine on computer, which I assume most people will be using if you have to download the code and access it locally
