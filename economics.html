                    <p>
                        Economics provides understanding for students about many aspects of the economy and its operation that are frequently reported in the media.
                        It investigates issues such as why unemployment or inflation rates change and how these changes will impact on individuals in society.
                        Economics develops studentsâ€™ knowledge and understanding of the operation of the global and Australian economy.
                        It develops the analytical, problem-solving and communication skills of students.
                        There is a strong emphasis on the problems and issues in a contemporary Australian economic context within the course.

                        All individuals and societies face decisions about how they will achieve all the things they want, given that they only have a limited amount of money and other resources.
                        The basis of the Economics course is the problem of choice between what we will have and what we will go without.
                        From this basis, we can explore many economic concepts.
                        Terms that you often hear such as inflation, unemployment, foreign debt, economic policy and exchange rates are all connected.
                        The causes and solutions to these economic problems are easily identified using the concepts and theories of Economics.
                        All concepts studied are tied into real- life Australian situations.
                        The course covers many concepts that students will find very useful if they go on to study Economics, Business and Business Administration, Accounting, Finance and related courses at a tertiary level.
                        Economics is a challenging and rewarding course for senior students.
                        Students need to develop good essay writing and mathematical skills.
                        More important would be an interest in the types of issues dealt with in Economics.
                        The majority of homework assignments are essays which require the students to bring together their knowledge of what they have learnt in class.
