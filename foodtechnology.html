                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Food Technology Preliminary course looks at what influences our choice in food and what foods are available in different areas of the world.
                        It is concerned with how quality food is achieved; including the methods for safe storage, safe preparation and presentation of food, sensory characteristics of food, and the functional properties of food or why recipe ingredients react in the way that they do.
                        Students will gain a greater knowledge of nutrition through investigation of the food nutrients and consuming them in combination to create a diet for optimum nutrition.
                        The HSC course builds on the concepts of the preliminary course by expanding on areas of production and processing of food including: preservation, packaging, storage and distribution of food and the impact of food manufacturing technologies on society and the environment.
                        Students will be involved in the development of a new food product through which will experiment and investigate factors which impact its development.
                        They will study reasons for and types of food product development, the steps in food product development, developing a new product and marketing the product.
                        Students will also look at the Australian food industry, its sectors and the policies and legislation that need to be adhered to by all who work within the industry.
                        There is also the study of an option topic either Nutrition or Marketplace.

                    <h3>Is this for me?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Any student interested in the creation, manipulation and development of food products and nutrition.
                        This subject works very well when studied in correlation with Hospitality, Business Studies and PD/H/PE for the HSC.
                        Career prospects for students that study Food technology include, Nutritionist, Fitness Trainer, Dietician, Food Taster, Food Designer, Food Stylist, Food Product Development, Chef, any person that is interested in food and nutrition.
