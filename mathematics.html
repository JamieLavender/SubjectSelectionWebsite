                    <p>
                        Mathematics Standard 1 is designed to help students improve their numeracy by building their confidence and success in making mathematics meaningful.
                        Numeracy is more than being able to operate with numbers.
                        It requires mathematical knowledge and understanding, mathematical problem-solving skills and literacy skills, as well as positive attitudes. When students become numerate they are able to manage a situation or solve a problem in real contexts, such as everyday life, work or further learning.
                        This course offers students the opportunity to prepare for post-school options of employment or further training.

                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mathematics Extension 2 provides students with the opportunity to develop strong mathematical manipulative skills and a deep understanding of the fundamental ideas of algebra and calculus, as well as an appreciation of mathematics as an activity with its own intrinsic value, involving invention, intuition and exploration.
                        Mathematics Extension 2 extends students’ conceptual knowledge and understanding through exploration of new areas of mathematics not previously seen.
                        The Mathematics Extension 2 Year 12 course includes the Mathematics Extension 1 Year 12 course and the Mathematics Advanced Year 12 course.
                        The Mathematics Advanced, Mathematics Extension 1 and Mathematics Extension 2 Stage 6 courses form a continuum.
                        All students studying the Mathematics Extension 2 course will sit for an HSC examination.
