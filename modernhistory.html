                        In this course students have an opportunity to engage in the investigation of the forces that have shaped the world.

                        The course introduces students to a range of cultures and beliefs, as well as ideas, values and behaviours that enrich their appreciation of humanity by introducing them to historical developments and experiences that have defined the modern world.

                        A study in history develops relevant contemporary skills such as the ability to analyse, to challenge accepted theories and interpretations, to understand ethics, to research and develop evidence based arguments.
                        These skills are key to most tertiary studies, employment and a vast number of professions.
                        A study in history helps you to improve valuable oral and written communication skills that are considered key skills for tertiary studies or future employment.
                        The knowledge, understanding and skills that you develop through the study of history create a firm foundation for further study, the world of work, active and informed citizenship, and for lifelong learning.
                        History fosters a critical approach to understanding events, issues and interpretations as well as the effective communication of accounts conveying ideas, judgments and evidence.
                        History can also be studied purely for interest and the gaining of knowledge of historical sites and events which will enhance your appreciation of overseas travel.
                        Students who have a particular interest or ability in History may choose to study BOTH Modern and Ancient History; and Extension History in Year 12.
