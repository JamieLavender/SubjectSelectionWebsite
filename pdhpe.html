                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>
                        Personal Development, Health and Physical Education (PDHPE) focuses on the health of individuals and communities as well as the factors that influence movement skill and physical activity levels.
                        The Stage 6 PDHPE course builds upon the PDHPE Years 7–10 experience by introducing students to more detailed study and higher order skills.
                        The PDHPE course includes a detailed study of movement and physical activity.
                        The emphasis is on understanding how the body moves and the sociocultural influences that regulate movement.
                        Scientific aspects to be studied include anatomy, physiology, biomechanics and skill acquisition.
                        This course is based on a social view of health where the principles of diversity, social justice and supportive environments are fundamental to health.
                        Health status and viable solutions for better health are examined for the individual, family and community.

                    <p>
                        The study of PDHPE supports students as they develop into young adults.
                        The course encourages personal growth, enhances wellbeing and develops the student’s capacity to take a productive role in society.
                        PDHPE provides a direct link with study and vocational pathways in the areas of recreational, paramedical, movement and health sciences.
                        Related career opportunities are expanding and gaining recognition throughout the community as legitimate fields of employment.
                        Some related career choices may include sports coaching, outdoor recreational leadership, sport and recreation program management, human resources, sports injury management, physical activity consultancy, health education/promotion officer, drug education and PDHPE teaching.
                        Subjects that would link with PDHPE include Community and Family Studies, Dance, Biology, Physics, Society and Culture, and also Sport, Lifestyle and Recreation.
