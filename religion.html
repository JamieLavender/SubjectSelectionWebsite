                        The Preliminary course commences with general religious and non-religious worldviews of the supernatural and the meaning of life.
                        Following, two or three world religions are studied in relation to their origins, principal beliefs, sacred texts, and ethics, such as Christianity, Judaism and Islam.
                        The 2 Unit course also includes a unit of religion in Australia which incorporates Aboriginal Spirituality, a fascinating exploration of Ancient Religions and the historical beliefs and practices of two ancient religions drawn from Celts, Daoists and Mayans.
                        The HSC course builds upon the Preliminary course.
                        The Religious Traditions commenced in the Preliminary course are studied in greater depth with a focus on a significant person, a significant practice, and ethics.
                        The unit on Religion in Australia continues and examines current religious adherence and practice. 2 Unit students complete additional units that explore the concept of peace within Christianity and Islam or Judaism, and examine the phenomenon of those who choose to nominate themselves as having ‘no religion’.

                        NESA includes this course within the domain of HSIE and so this is an objective area of study that examines the phenomena of religion as being ‘living’ and influencing the life of its adherents.
                        In Australia, there are many people who come from a variety of cultures and religious traditions so it is helpful to understand a range of beliefs and practices.
                        Whilst writing skills are developed throughout the unit, students who have advanced writing and reading skills are advised to select this course.
                        Students who are planning to take an extension course, such as Math or English, are advised to consider the 1 Unit option.
                        Students who choose Society and Culture as an area of study are advised to also consider this course, as they would find many areas of overlapping content and key concepts.

                    <p>
                        The New Curriculum reflects Jesus’ invitation to ‘come and see,’ and to ‘push out into the deep.’
                        Seeking to follow His example and inspired by an incarnational spirituality, making Christ real, the curriculum models an inclusive and transcendent invitation to encounter Christ in the daily paradox of life, to discern ‘God in all things.’
                        To reflect ‘the one in whom we live, move and have our being.’ (Acts 17:28)
                        The curriculum seeks to awaken a sacramental vision of reality, through proclaiming the ‘living voice of the Gospel.’ With Pope Francis, Bishop Vincent and the whole faith community, we strive to ensure that every young person experiences metanoia: a joyful, blessed, transcendent and transformational education.
                        A Catholic education, understood as a ‘gateway’ to human flourishing, one that liberates each person to live their life to the full: ‘I have come that you may have life and have it to the full.’
