                    <p>
                        The Preliminary course develops a knowledge of Design within the textiles industry.
                        It focuses on the elements and principles of design, functional and aesthetic designs and different communication techniques that are used throughout the industry.
                        Students explore the properties and performance of textiles with the development of research and experimentation skills to determine fibre, yarn and fabric properties, types, classification, identification, and structures.
                        The course also looks at the Australian Textiles, Clothing, Footwear and Allied Industry including its past, present and future, and the quality and value of textiles within Australian society.
                        Students explore many different manufacturing methods.
                        Preliminary Textile Project 1 – Costume - focuses on the generation and communication of ideas, design modification, manipulative skills, evaluation of ideas and the project, and management of time and resources.
                        Preliminary Textile Project 2 – Functional Product - focuses on an analysis of fabric, yarn and fibre properties, experimental procedures, product design, fabric choice, manipulative and management skills, communication methods and the recording of information.
                        The HSC course builds on the concepts of the preliminary course by expanding on areas of Design, Properties and Performance and The Australian Textiles, Clothing, Footwear and Allied Industries (ATCFAI). Specific content includes Design - Fashion throughout history, Fabric colouration and decoration techniques, cultural factors that influence design and designers.
                        Design also includes a case study on traditional Japanese textiles and researching Australian
                        Contemporary designers. Properties and Performance - Fabrics for specific purposes and Innovations and emerging textile technologies.
                        ATCFAI - Appropriate textile technology and environmental sustainability, Current issues within the industry and a closer look at the textiles marketplace.
                        Major Textiles Project - each student works independently on a textile project of their own choice.
                        There is also a portfolio component to the MTP that is worth 25% of the overall HSC mark for textiles.
